### Hello there ðŸ¥‹ðŸ‘‹


 I'm Leo, currently studying at school 42 Porto. <br>
 I really enjoy always acquiring new knowledge, as a student of Programming and philosophy. <br>
 And maybe one day an aerospace student too (my dream).<br>
 My goal is to one day participate in a project that will have a major impact on the world.<br>
